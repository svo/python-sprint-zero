# Claude Code Skills for Python Sprint Zero

This directory contains custom Claude Code skills tailored to this project's strict architectural and coding standards.

## Installed Skills (Tier 1 - Highest Value)

### 1. Hexagonal Architecture Feature Scaffolder
**Directory:** `hexagonal-architecture-scaffolder/`
**Trigger phrases:** "create a new feature", "scaffold a feature", "add a new domain entity", "create a new API endpoint"

**Purpose:** Guides Claude through creating complete features across all hexagonal architecture layers (domain → application → infrastructure → interface) with proper dependency injection, layer boundaries, and test coverage.

**Key features:**
- Step-by-step scaffolding across all layers
- Enforces layer boundary rules
- Generates repository interfaces in domain, implementations in infrastructure

### 2. Test Generator with One-Assertion Rule
**Directory:** `test-generator/`
**Trigger phrases:** "generate tests", "create tests for", "write test cases", "add test coverage"

**Purpose:** Generates tests following the project's mandatory one-assertion-per-test rule with proper naming (`test_should_X_when_Y`), Arrange-Act-Assert structure, and appropriate mocking.

**Key features:**
- Enforces one assertion per test (critical project rule)
- Generates descriptive test names following pattern
- Creates Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- Provides testing patterns by layer (domain, application, infrastructure, interface)
- Shows how to properly mock dependencies

### 3. Self-Documenting Code Refactorer
**Directory:** `self-documenting-refactor/`
**Trigger phrases:** "remove comments", "make code self-documenting", "refactor to eliminate comments", "improve code clarity"

**Purpose:** Enforces the project's strict NO COMMENTS policy by helping refactor code to be self-explanatory through expressive naming instead of comments.

**Key features:**
- Identifies comments in code
- Suggests refactoring strategies (extract to well-named function, expressive variables, boolean conditions, named constants)
- Provides before/after examples
- Teaches naming conventions for functions, variables, constants, booleans
- Includes common refactoring patterns

**Trigger phrases:** "implement feature", "fix bug", "write code", "TDD", "red-green-refactor"

**Purpose:** Enforces the TDD methodology with strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle. Ensures no production code is written without a failing test first.

**Key features:**
- Iron Law: No production code without failing test first
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle enforcement
- Common rationalizations and rebuttals

### 6. Systematic Debugging
**Directory:** `systematic-debugging/`
**Trigger phrases:** "debug", "fix bug", "test failure", "unexpected behavior", "error", "not working"

**Purpose:** Provides systematic debugging methodology. Ensures root cause investigation before attempting fixes.

**Key features:**
- Four-phase process (Root Cause → Pattern Analysis → Hypothesis → Implementation)
- Multi-component system diagnostics
- Evidence gathering before fixes
- Architecture questioning after 3+ failed fixes
- Red flag detection for premature fix attempts

**Supporting files:**
- `root-cause-tracing.md` - Backward tracing through call stack
- `defense-in-depth.md` - Multi-layer validation patterns
- `condition-based-waiting.md` - Replace timeouts with condition polling

---

### 7. Verification Before Completion
**Directory:** `verification-before-completion/`
**Trigger phrases:** "done", "complete", "fixed", "passing", "commit", "create PR", "finished"

**Purpose:** Requires running verification commands and confirming output before making any success claims. Evidence before assertions, always.

**Key features:**
- Gate function: Identify → Run → Read → Verify → Claim
- Common failure patterns and what each claim requires
- Rationalization prevention table
- Red flag detection for premature claims

---

### 8. Sequential Thinking
**Directory:** `sequential-thinking/`
**Trigger phrases:** "think through", "break down", "analyze step by step", "reason about", "sequential thinking"

**Purpose:** A structured, reflective problem-solving process that breaks complex problems into numbered thought steps with revision, branching, hypothesis generation, and verification.

**Key features:**
- Numbered thought steps with scope estimation
- Explicit revision markers when earlier thoughts were wrong
- Branching for exploring alternative approaches
- Hypothesis generation and verification cycles
- Anti-pattern detection for shallow reasoning
- Integration points with other skills (debugging, scaffolding, TDD)

## How Claude Code Uses Skills

### Proactive Skills (Triggered by Claude's Behaviour)
These skills activate automatically based on what Claude is doing, without the user needing to ask:

- **systematic-debugging** — Claude enters this when it encounters a bug, test failure, or unexpected behaviour
- **test-driven-development** — Claude follows this when implementing any feature or bugfix, writing tests before production code
- **verification-before-completion** — Claude runs this before claiming work is complete, ensuring evidence before assertions
- **sequential-thinking** — Claude uses this when breaking down complex problems, planning, or making architecture decisions with trade-offs

### Reactive Skills (Triggered by User Requests)
These skills activate when the user asks for something specific:

- **hexagonal-architecture-scaffolder** — "Create a new feature", "scaffold a feature", "add a new domain entity", "create a new API endpoint"
- **test-generator** — "Generate tests", "create tests for", "write test cases", "add test coverage"
- **self-documenting-refactor** — "Remove comments", "make code self-documenting", "refactor to eliminate comments"
- **property-based-testing** — "Property-based testing", "roundtrip test", "serialization test", "hypothesis test"

### Slash Command Invocation
Any skill can be explicitly invoked as a slash command:
- `/hexagonal-architecture-scaffolder` - Scaffold a new feature across all architecture layers
- `/test-generator` - Generate tests with one-assertion-per-test rule
- `/self-documenting-refactor` - Refactor code to eliminate comments
- `/property-based-testing` - Apply property-based testing patterns
- `/test-driven-development` - Follow TDD red-green-refactor cycle
- `/systematic-debugging` - Apply systematic debugging methodology
- `/verification-before-completion` - Verify work before claiming completion
- `/sequential-thinking` - Break down complex problems into sequential reasoning steps

### Progressive Disclosure
Skills use progressive disclosure:
- Main `SKILL.md` contains core guidance (1,500-2,000 words)
- `references/` directory contains detailed examples and patterns
- `templates/` directory contains ready-to-use code templates
- `scripts/` directory contains executable helper scripts

Claude Code loads the main skill first, then references supporting files as needed.

## Skill Development Guidelines

These skills follow Claude Code best practices:

1. **Clear trigger phrases** - Specific, concrete phrases users would naturally say
2. **Imperative writing** - Direct instructions ("Create", "Add", "Use")
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Main guidance is concise, details in references
4. **Project-specific** - Tailored to this project's unique rules and patterns
5. **Complementary to testing** - Skills teach generation, automated tests validate

## Project-Specific Rules Enforced by Skills

All skills enforce these critical project rules:

- **NO COMMENTS** - Code must be self-documenting
- **One assertion per test** - Each test function has exactly ONE assertion
- **Layer boundaries** - Respect hexagonal architecture import restrictions
- **Dependency injection** - Always use Lagom DI, never direct instantiation
- **100% test coverage** - Every function must have tests
- **Type hints** - All function signatures must have type hints
- **`__init__.py` required** - All Python packages must have this file

## Testing Skills

To test if skills are working:

1. **Try trigger phrases in Claude Code:**
   - "Create a new product feature"
   - "Generate tests for ProductService"
   - "Remove comments from this code"
   - "Debug this test failure"
   - "Implement the search feature"

2. **Verify skill loads:**
   - Claude should reference the skill in its response
   - Guidance should match skill content

3. **Check skill is applied:**
   - Generated code follows skill patterns
   - Layer boundaries respected
   - Tests have one assertion
   - No comments in generated code

## Extending Skills

To add more skills:

1. Create directory: `.claude/skills/skill-name/`
2. Add `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and instructions
3. Optionally add `references/`, `templates/`, `scripts/` subdirectories
4. Use specific trigger phrases in description
5. Keep main skill body concise (1,500-2,000 words)
6. Update this README
